# my-first-capstone

Contains a basic outline of the employee database app. 

It is preferred you run the files in visual studio code, but you can view the html files any way you wish. 

An app designed for employee database management.

You can clone a repo of the greybox wireframe at the following link.  https://github.com/Nekotree/my-first-capstone
Please note, components are divided into seperate folders that display basic HTML/CSS for various pages in the app. 

The user flows are as follows.

Upon opening the app the user will be displayed a Landing Page. It explains the basics of the app and provides a login option and create new user option at the bottom of the page.

If the user chooses the login option they are taken to a login page for authentication.

They are then taken to the main page

If the user creates an account, they are taken to the main page.

When the user is at the main page, they have a list of actions that they can perform. Such as create a new employee, view the employee database, update employee data, and delete employee data.

If the user chooses View employee database, it takes them to their entire list of employees.

If the user chooses Update employee profile, it takes them to an update page profile page.

Please note that additional pages are still required, such as buttons that go back to the main page after any of the CRUD functions have been performned. I am going to implement those. As well as pages that state if any of the CRUD functions have been sucessfully performed. These will be implemented as well.
